# Tutorials

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/COGS108/Tutorials/master)

This repository is a set of tutorials for Hands-On Data Science. It is used to run along with the UC San Diego course COGS108 - [Data Science in Practice](https://github.com/COGS108/Overview). These tutorials presume some knowledge of the Python programming language. 

### Approach / Background

These tutorials are designed to be a minimal introduction to what you need to know to get working with data science - to start to be able getting and examing data, and building up to working on data-science related projects. They cover the hands-on, coding components of the material. 

Conceptual and background material is covered in the [Lectures](https://github.com/COGS108/Lectures). Practice with these ideas is done through the [Assignments](https://github.com/COGS108/Assignments) as well as materials for doing [Projects](https://github.com/COGS108/Projects).

These tutorials also try to interface with the vast world of existing tutorials, materials, and documentation. They are explicitly designed to give a quick introduction to a topic of interest, and then link out to more comprehensive resources. In that sense, they are designed to be more like a yellow pages, than an encyclopedia. 

### Requirements

The code and materials in this repository are created with [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org) and require the [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Any other dependencies, for specific Tutorials, are specifically addressed in the notebooks. 

### Development

This repository is under active development, and is primarily developed and maintained by [TomDonoghue](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/), as well as by the COGS108 [staff](https://github.com/COGS108/Overview/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md).

Contributions to this resource are welcome and encouraged! If you have suggestions for new links or materials, and/or fixes for any issues you spot, you are welcome and invited to open Issues, and/or submit a Pull Request.
